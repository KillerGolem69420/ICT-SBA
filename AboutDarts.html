            <h2>About Darts</h2>
            <p>Darts is a popular pub game played by throwing small missiles (darts) at a circular target board, called a dartboard. It is a game of skill, precision, and strategy.</p>
            <p>The objective of the game is to score points by hitting specific areas on the dartboard. The board is divided into numbered sections, with the center known as the bullseye. Players take turns throwing three darts each, aiming to score as many points as possible.</p>
            <p>Darts can be played in various formats, such as 501, 301, or Cricket. Each format has its own rules and scoring system.</p>

            <p>The dartboard consists of different sections, each with a specific point value. The sections are divided into:
            <ul>
                <li>The outer ring, known as the double ring, which doubles the points scored in that section</li>
                <li>The inner ring, known as the triple ring, which triples the points scored in that section</li>
                <li>The bullseye, divided into an outer bull (25 points) and an inner bull (50 points)</li>
            </ul>
